What is codelinestatistics ?
----------------------------------------

This is a project for code line statistics. It is written by ruby and provides a GUI (use FOX) for end user. Now it can count a lot of file types, including .c, .cpp, .css, .html, .java, .js, .jsp, .php, .properties, .py, .rhtml, .rb, .xml, .yml. And it will parse the other file types future. Now you can use parser map to extend the app. For example, the comment rule of .h and .cpp files are same, so you can order the app use .cpp parser to parse .h file.
The GUI provides visualized results, which is divided into two parts. One is the total results including total files, total sizes of files, total lines, total lines of codes, total lines of comments and total lines of blanks. The other is a table which displays details information about each file, the information is composed of file name, directory name, total lines, code lines, comment lines, blank lines and file type. The visualized results can be also exported to a .html file.  Besides these, it provides a dialog to customize. For example, the trailing comment line can be treated as a code line, a comment line or a code line plus a comment line.
