What is CodeLineStatistics ?
----------------------------------------
This is a project for code line statistics. It is written by ruby and provides 
a GUI (use FOX) for end user. Now it can count the most of file types of Ruby 
and Java projects, including .rb, .rhtml, .yml, .java, .xml, .html, .jsp and 
.properties files. And it will parse the other file types future. The GUI provides 
visualized results, which is divided into two parts. One is the total results 
including total files, total sizes of files, total lines, total lines of codes, 
total lines of comments and total lines of blanks. The other is a table which 
displays details information about each file, the information is composed of 
file name, directory name, total lines, code lines, comment lines, blank lines 
and file type. The visualized results can be also exported to a .html file. 
Besides these, it provides a dialog to customize. For example, the trailing comment 
line can be treated as a code line, a comment line or a code line plus a comment line.
